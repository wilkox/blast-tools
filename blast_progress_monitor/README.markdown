#BLAST progress monitor
A simple tool for monitoring the progress of BLAST searches, estimating their completion times and reporting basic statistics such as hit rate. Supports creation of partial query files to fill in the missing pieces of searches which have crashed midway, or are missing a section of output.

Currently designed for use with either stand-alone BLAST searches or searches running on the Sun Grid Engine, but it would be nice to add support for other environments. Contributions very welcome.

#Requirements
Requires perl. Some functions require the R statistical package. Written for a linux or other unix-like environment.
