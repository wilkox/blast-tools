#About
Visualise BLAST fragment recruitment to a reference genome. 

#Coverage plotter
Plots the read depth across the reference genome, either base-by-base or with a moving window average. Can overlay up to five queries onto a single plot. Also supports basic mapping of features e.g. genes onto the reference genome. Can produce log-scale plot.

#Percent identity plotter
Plots each HIT (not READ) on the reference genome, so make sure you pre-filter your blast output to exactly what you want to plot! Reads can be optionally be coloured by evalue, as with [CAMERA's](http://camera.calit2.net/) fragment recruitment tool.

#Possible future improvements
- Rewrite as a native R script or package
- Support circular genomes

#Requirements
Requires `perl` and `R`. Written for a linux or other unix-like environment.
