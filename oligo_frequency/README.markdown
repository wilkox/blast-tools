#Oligonucleotide frequency counter
A simple tool for counting n-nucleotide frequencies in simple (no degenerate bases) DNA sequences.

#Usage
Call oligonucleotide_frequency_counter.pl with as many multifasta files as you want, and optionally with -n <oligonucleotide length> - default is 4. It assumes fasta headers are unique.

#Requirements
Requires perl.
